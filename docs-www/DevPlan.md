# Development Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Input and Output Framework

### Goal
Set up the foundation for handling input and generating basic output.

### Steps
1. **Text-Based Input and Output (CLI/Web)**
   - Develop a simple CLI or web interface to take user text input and display responses.
   - Output Format: Plain text and Markdown file creation.

2. **Task Storage**
   - Set up a local SQLite database to store tasks, notes, and other structured data.

### Tools
- **Text Processing**: spaCy (local, lightweight) for text normalization.
- **Database**: SQLite (local, serverless).

## Phase 2: Voice Interaction

### Goal
Enable the assistant to accept voice input and provide speech output.

### Steps
1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
   - Add functionality to transcribe user speech into text.
   - Allow fallback to text input for environments without audio capabilities.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - Implement a text-to-speech engine to read responses aloud.

### Tools
- **STT (Local)**: Whisper (OpenAI) for robust offline transcription.
- **STT (Cloud)**: Google Speech-to-Text API for scalable, accurate transcription.
- **TTS (Local)**: Coqui TTS or pyttsx3 for offline speech synthesis.
- **TTS (Cloud)**: Google Text-to-Speech API or Amazon Polly for natural-sounding voices.

## Phase 3: Task Understanding with NLP

### Goal
Add natural language understanding to process user commands effectively.

### Steps
1. **Intent Recognition**
   - Implement a model to classify user intents (e.g., add task, summarize week).

2. **Entity Recognition**
   - Use an NER model to extract key details like task names, dates, or deadlines.

3. **Basic Task Processing**
   - Add logic to handle common intents (e.g., adding a task, retrieving tasks).

### Tools
1. **Intent Recognition**
   - Local: Fine-tune BERT (Hugging Face) or use Rasa Intent Classifier.
   - Cloud: Use Dialogflow or Microsoft LUIS.

2. **Entity Recognition**
   - Local: spaCy’s NER or Hugging Face’s bert-base-NER.
   - Cloud: Amazon Comprehend for NER.

## Phase 4: Response Generation

### Goal
Generate natural, conversational responses for user commands.

### Steps
1. **Response Generation**
   - Implement a text generation model to create polished responses based on user queries and actions.

2. **Markdown Export**
   - Automatically save task summaries, notes, and accomplishments as Markdown files.

### Tools
1. **Response Generation**
   - Local: GPT-2 or T5 (Hugging Face) for lightweight, offline text generation.
   - Cloud: OpenAI ChatGPT API for advanced conversational capabilities.

2. **Markdown Management**
   - Use Python-Markdown to convert and save responses to .md files.

## Phase 5: Web-Based Interface

### Goal
Build a web interface for a more user-friendly experience.

### Steps
1. **Frontend Interface**
   - Develop a simple web interface using Flask (local server) for interaction.
   - Display tasks, notes, and summaries dynamically.

2. **Markdown Rendering**
   - Render Markdown files visually on the web interface.

3. **Basic Data Visualization**
   - Add simple charts for task progress or weekly accomplishments.

### Tools
- **Frontend Framework**: Flask (local, lightweight) or React.js (scalable).
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive visualizations.

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Goal
Expand the assistant's functionality with advanced capabilities.

### Steps
1. **Advanced Task Automation**
   - Implement scheduling and reminders for tasks.

2. **Integration with External Tools**
   - Sync with calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
   - Optionally, connect with Notion or Trello for task management.

3. **Personalized AI**
   - Train or fine-tune models on your personal data for tailored interactions.

### Tools
- **Task Scheduling**: APScheduler for local automation.
- **Integration Tools**: Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 (cloud) or larger Hugging Face models (local with GPU).
