# Personal Assistant Project

## Overview
This project implements a personal assistant application that can handle various tasks through natural language processing. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and capable of understanding and executing user commands in a conversational manner.

## Key Features
- **Voice Interaction**: Support for both voice input and output
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Advanced processing of user commands
- **Task Management**: Efficient handling of various user tasks
- **Markdown Generation**: Automatic documentation creation
- **Web Interface**: Clean, modern UI for interaction and visualization

## Architecture
The system is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Input Processing**
   - Voice-to-Text conversion
   - Text normalization
   - Intent recognition

2. **Core Processing**
   - Entity extraction
   - Task logic handling
   - Context management

3. **Output Generation**
   - Response generation
   - Text-to-Speech conversion
   - Markdown documentation

4. **Storage Layer**
   - Task persistence
   - User preferences
   - System logs

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes both open-source and cloud-based solutions:

### Local Components
- Python for core processing
- Flask for web interface
- SQLite for local storage
- Various NLP libraries

### Cloud Services
- Speech recognition APIs
- Language understanding services
- Cloud storage solutions

## Development Status
