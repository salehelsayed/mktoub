# Phase 1: Simple Text-Based UI with OpenAI Integration

## Goal
Establish a foundational user interface that allows users to input text, sends this input to OpenAI's API, and displays the generated responses.

## Steps

### UI Development

#### Choose Framework
- **Web Interface**: Use Flask for a lightweight local server or React.js for a more dynamic and scalable frontend.

#### Design Interface
Create a clean and intuitive interface with:
- A text input field for user queries
- A display area for showing responses from OpenAI
- Basic navigation elements if needed

### Backend Integration

#### Set Up Server
- If using Flask, set up routes to handle incoming requests from the frontend

#### Connect to OpenAI API
- Implement API calls to OpenAI's GPT-4 (or relevant model) to send user inputs and receive responses
- Ensure secure handling of API keys and manage rate limits

### Output Handling

#### Display Responses
- Render the plain text responses from OpenAI in the UI
- Optionally, support Markdown rendering for better formatting using libraries like marked.js (for React) or Python-Markdown (for Flask)

#### Basic Error Handling
- Implement error messages for failed API calls or invalid inputs
- Provide user feedback for loading states during API interactions

### Tools
- **Frontend**: Flask or React.js
- **Backend**: Python (with Flask) or Node.js (for React.js backend)
- **API Integration**: OpenAI Python SDK or relevant HTTP client
- **Styling**: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a responsive design

# Phase 2: Task Understanding with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Goal
Enhance the assistant's capability to understand and manage tasks by implementing NLP techniques, allowing users to see development progress directly on the web UI.

## Steps

### Set Up Local Database for Task Storage

#### Database Selection
- Use SQLite for a lightweight, serverless database to store tasks, notes, and related data

#### Schema Design
- Define tables for tasks, including fields like task ID, description, status, deadlines, and timestamps

### Integrate NLP for Task Management

#### Intent Recognition
- Implement a model to classify user intents related to task management (e.g., add task, update task, view tasks)
- **Tools**: Fine-tune BERT (via Hugging Face) or use Rasa Intent Classifier for local processing

#### Entity Recognition
- Extract key details such as task names, dates, priorities, and deadlines from user inputs
- **Tools**: Utilize spaCy's NER or Hugging Face's bert-base-NER for local entity extraction

### Develop Task Processing Logic
- **Add Task**: Parse user input to create and store new tasks in the SQLite database
- **Update Task**: Modify existing tasks based on user commands (e.g., mark as complete, change deadline)
- **Retrieve Tasks**: Fetch and display tasks based on user queries (e.g., list all tasks, show pending tasks)

### UI Enhancements for Task Display

#### Task Dashboard
- Create sections on the web interface to display current tasks, completed tasks, and upcoming deadlines

#### Dynamic Updates
- Use AJAX or WebSockets to update the task list in real-time without requiring page reloads

#### Visual Indicators
- Implement status indicators (e.g., progress bars, color codes) to represent task statuses visually

### Progress Tracking and Visualization

#### Basic Analytics
- Display summaries such as the number of tasks completed, pending tasks, and upcoming deadlines

#### Simple Charts
- Integrate Chart.js or similar libraries to visualize task progress over time

### Tools
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, Rasa
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy (for ORM) or direct SQL queries
- **Backend Enhancements**: Extend Flask or backend server to handle task-related API endpoints
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Update React.js components or Flask templates to include task dashboards and visualizations
- **Visualization Libraries**: Chart.js for rendering progress charts

# Future Phases (Optional): Expansion and Advanced Features
While initially focusing on text-based interactions and task management, you can plan for future enhancements as follows:

## Phase 3: Response Generation and Markdown Export
- Implement advanced response generation using more sophisticated models
- Automatically export task summaries and notes as Markdown files

## Phase 4: Web-Based Interface Enhancements
- Improve the web UI with better styling, user authentication, and more interactive elements
- Enhance data visualization with more complex charts and user-specific dashboards

## Phase 5: Advanced Task Automation and Integration
- Add features like task scheduling, reminders, and integration with external tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Trello)

## Phase 6: Personalized AI Interactions
- Fine-tune models on personal data to offer more tailored and personalized user experiences
